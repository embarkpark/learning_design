Initial languages supported: Python, JavaScript (within Node).

Later add for lower-level coverage: C and possibly some flavor of assembly (they're very similar really).

Yet-other languages let's reserve for the later phase where we specifically treat client-side programming vs server-side programming.

It's expected that you will come in knowing at least one language well enough to solve actual problems with it. (Not just toy problems -- actual problems).

So this module is intended to be more of a refresher.
