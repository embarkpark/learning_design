## The purposes of this learning

This training assumes that you are early in your journey as a software engineer and want to do good work.

The goal of this training is for you to learn a problem-solving approach and toolkit that senior engineers tend to use.

By approaching your tasks in that way, you will have more success in job-seeking and on the job.

### Assumed background

* You have have completed a course like Harvard CS50, a coding bootcamp, or even an entire degree in a technical discipline. 
* You are now wondering how to get a good entry-level position in the industry, and do well in it.
* OR you do have an entry-level job, and are wondering how to do well in it / get a better one.

## Professionalism

A student is primarily concerned with getting good scores, getting through a course. These concerns in a sense are self-centered. _Your_ scores, _your_ graduation, _your_ interests, _your_ offers, _your_ compensation, and so on. Nothing wrong with being focused on your own needs, of course, but that's inherently just a personal stance, not a professional one.

A professional, by definition, is paid to produce results for clients. As such, a reliable professional demonstrates and acts upon outward-facing concern for the needs of their clients.

Even if you are not yet being paid by a specific client, nonetheless, you are beyond mere student status.  You are a professional.

Although this training is a kind of a course of study, it has a very practical and reality-based orientation. We want to urge you to avoid falling into the trap of thinking like a student.

If you are job-seeking, or will be again at some point, then in a sense, your "customer" is the members of the hiring team.

How can you demonstrate concern for the needs of these clients?

## What hiring teams seek

In order to organize any product or project, an excellent rule-of-thumb is to use _backward design_, i.e., work backwards from the intended outcomes.

Oftentimes the intended outcome involves a decision or action made by _other people_. In the case of getting a good job, that decision is the members of the hiring committee, which usually includes managers and teammates.

So, how to influence the decisions and actions of other people?

First it makes sense to understand their point of view. When you understand their "felt needs", you can make a logical plan to address those needs and thereby influence them.

If you were an engineering manager, what would your felt needs be, as they pertain to hiring? Many entry-level people assume that the answer to this question involves the names of technologies, like "knows Python". And yes, a programmer needs to be able to use various languages and tools in order to get work done. However, it's important not to overlook the concept of risk management. 

Any production software project is beset with delivery risks. Good engineers operate in a manner that consciously manages those risks.

To take one example, here's an approach to development that helps to mitigate risk:

* Debugging is extremely time-consuming.
* Unexpected debugging can derail the delivery schedule.
* We want to minimize the amount of time spent debugging.
* The best way to do this is to avoid the introduction of bugs in the first place.
* There are many anti-patterns that introduce bugs.
* One such anti-pattern is having insufficient automated testing.
* Thus, I write automated tests.
* Thus, I run test coverage tools.
* Thus, I set up continuous integration to run the tests upon every commit.
* Thus, I gently nudge my teammates (in code review feedback) to enhance their test coverage.
* Thus, I investigated and introduced an end-to-end testing tool.

And so on.

Can you feel it yourself, as you scan the above bullet points? A sense of reassurance. A sense that this engineer is more likely to help keep our releases stable. This engineer is going to reduce our team's delivery risk.

To the extent that _you_ are that engineer, you will pattern-match more and more to what the team needs. This makes it easier and easier to get offers to work with high-functioning teams, the kind of teams that you want to be working with.

## engineering: -ilities

To expand on the topic of risk management, we can consider some broad best-practices that have been established over the years by generations of engineers.

These are some desirable traits of a software system that collectively are sometimes called "-ilities", due to the common suffix:

* usability
* maintainability
* reliability
* extensibility
* scalability

There are [many more besides this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes#Quality_attributes) but the ones above capture a lot of the gist.

Imagine working with engineers who care about, think in terms of, and act to realize the above traits of the systems they build.

All other things held equal, wouldn't that be a team you'd like to work on?

Be that engineer.

## Soft skills matter too. 

A high-functioning engineering team is composed of highly autonomous, capable, individually-productive members.

Such members understand that being "stuck" is an honorable and normal state, and work to get themselves unstuck without imposing unduly on their teammates.

Such members are able to build substantial subsystems and features entirely by themselves, without needing to call in implementation help from others.

However, while they are _able_ to operate in an "army of one" fashion -- they generally don't _want_ to do so. Rather, they want to operate collaboratively with their teammates, reviewing specs, reviewing technical designs, reviewing code, discussing and deciding together. 

Good teams recognize that everyone makes mistakes, that there are usually multiple ways to accomplish things, that no one has a monopoly on good ideas, and in general we can do more if we build together in harmony.

This points to the importance of soft skills even in a highly-technical construction environment. We use our soft skills to maintain harmonious workflows while building.

Hiring teams will be looking for evidence that you are such an engineer.
