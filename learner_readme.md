# Intro for Learners
* The goal of this course is to make people more product minded and better problem solvers.
  * Hiring managers want to know junior dev's can solve their problems.
* Simply solving problems isn't enough to make someone a senior dev though.
  * This course will help you **understand** how the underlying structure of your code works, instead of relying on [cargo cult mentality](./glossary/cargo_cult_mentality.md) as to how your code works.

# About This Course
* We want to introduce [professional programming](./meta/type_of_programming.md).
* Because we want to focus more on patterns and design, we're trying to move away from languages and LeetCode grinding.
* The idea is to introduce *big ideas* and *themes* that introduce cross-cutting powerful concepts and techniques. In the case of debugging, the overarching theme is being systematic, not random. Then breaking down what "systematic" means
  * For example, the idea of steadily halving the problem space, to chase the bug into a corner
> example given by Tim for module goals  

* We will have a big project at the end (possibly with other ppl) where the goal is to get "users" to show employers that you've worked on something that real world application instead of just small projects.

# About the Modules
* Each module will be independent, so you can do whatever module you like in any other you want.
* The modules will have activities to help solidify the *big ideas* along with self-assessment checklists for **you** reference how you did.
  * This will give independence, so you won't have to rely on a senior dev or "instructor" to move forward.
* There will also be a mini-capstone at the end of each module to make sure you understood and know how to apply all the *big ideas* and *themes*.
