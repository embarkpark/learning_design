# Cargo Cult Mentality

Cargo cult thinking is the belief that if we simply emulate the visible effects of achievement, the real achievement will follow automatically. Especially, when the initial results look promising, we tend to think we are skilled, while in reality, we are lucky.

**Background**  
The term cargo cult was first coined after World War II. During the conflict, several remote-island-based airfields were established in the Pacific for military purposes, baffling the indigenous, primitive populations. Often limited or no contact was established between the islanders and the more modern military forces. When the military finally left the islands, the original inhabitants tried to recreate the airfields using bamboo, stone, and other available material, waiting for the planes to return. Hence the name cargo cult thinking: If you build it, they will come.
