Thank you for joining Embark Park as a contributor. Here are a few things you should know about this project, and if you still have questions, don’t hesitate to reach out on [discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/934598444629241916/934598444629241919).  

## Problem Statement
Junior developers or people looking for their first dev job often lack the skills needed to get the job they want. They think that having years of professional experience will solve their problems, but that’s not always the case. On the other side, hiring managers and companies can’t find enough developers with the skills they need to solve their problems.  

## Embark Park's Objective
We want developers, especially juniors, to gain the foundations and knowledge needed to land them a good job. We want people to better understand how their code actually works so that when they run into bugs, they’ll understand how to fix it. We want people to be product minded and problem solvers.  

We want people to think about building [features](./resources/feature_primitives.md), regardless of what specific language they know. In fact, we will link them with reference materials for them when they are building their projects. After completing this project, devs should feel confident about creating any of these [applications](./resources/app_types.md).

You can find more information **[here for Target Outcomes](./meta/target_outcomes.md)**.  
Here is our [narrative](./structure/toc_narrative.md) to understanding the flow of the course.  
How we want the [type of programming targeted](./meta/type_of_programming.md) to approach our course.

## What We’re Trying to Avoid
* We won’t subject people to tutorial hell or just repeat information that's already widely available  
  * There are enough tutorials and resources for people who just want to learn how to code (i.e. Udemy, Bootcamp, School, Edx). We do not want people to get stuck in tutorial hell.
* Activities should not be just basic toy examples, like someone buying 50 watermelons, but rather have a more real aspect to it so that the learners can see how it is implemented in a real world situation or on the job.
* We also want to avoid being a language dependent project. We want to teach them the fundamentals and patterns so that once they learn the basic syntax of things they should be able to understand whatever they’re coding.  
  * Think leetcode/codewars. They have the same problem, but you can solve them in any language that they have a check for.

## How We’re Trying to Structure This Project 
* We will use an [andragogical approach](./meta/androgogical_approach.md)
* The modules should be standalone modules, meaning that if someone wants to start with the first module, but then wants to jump to the last, they should be able to do so without having to learn all the other modules in between
  * Each module should have a few activities to solidify the `Big Ideas` of the modules, as well as a `Capstone` at the end to combine all the big ideas into one workflow.
    * The activities and Assessment will also have a self assessment checklist that learners can see if they did what the module was trying to teach them
* We also want to make learners more aware of concepts they might not have heard of or are too familiar with, in order to not only have more tools in their arsenal, but also to make googling things easier.
* The ultimate end goal of this project is to get Jr. Dev’s, or people fresh out of school, a good job they’ll actually like at the level of at least a Mid-level if not Senior Dev. In order to do so, we’ll have to teach them to take the training wheels they picked up in school off, and build a solid foundation of how things they’re building actually work. That way, when they run into bugs/problems, they’ll understand how to solve it and help others work more efficiently as well.
  * By understanding how things actually work, we also have the expectation of learners being able to understand how libraries/modules talk to each other instead of just relying on knowing that a certain method in a library does something, but not knowing how.
  * We understand that going from a Jr. Dev to Senior is hard and takes a lot of time and experience. What we’re trying to do is make that goal go from impossible, to just barely do-able. It will be a lot of work, but if they can stick through this, we should be able to ask their co-workers or managers how they’ve improved over the past few months and everyone should have noticed some significant changes.
* We also want them to be able to write actual “Good Code”. Part of what makes someone a Senior Dev, along with the knowhow and experience, is being able to write good, efficient code.

## How to Contribute
* Take a look at [our trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/LJFxr2tb/a4da82cd20a82d989ffff6c7950afef6/embark-park) board and pick out modules you’d like to work on from the “Todo”. If you don’t see the module or activity you want to work on there, please write a new card and add it to the “Doing” as well as assigning yourself the card so everyone can be on the same page about what is being worked on at the moment.
* When working on a module, follow the flow and structure of the [Functions_1](./modules/functions_1/overview.md) module as a guide/template for the other modules.
  * It should include: `Overview`, `Big Ideas`, `Summary` and `Activities`
  * Don’t worry too much about the activities at the moment, but focus more on the content first.
    * When you do get to making the activities, try to make an activity for each “Big Idea” in the module along with a checklist of “good practices” so that the learner can self-assess themselves.
* You can view our [ToC](./toc.md) for the list of modules
