## Target outcomes

This training aims for the following outcomes:

* Converting "very junior" programmers into "seasoned junior" programmers (see below), with demonstrable relevant skills and knowledge, ready to expand rapidly further upon joining their regular team.
* Expanding the sense of personal possibility, personal agency and self-confidence.
* Instilling a lifelong learning and metacognitive attitude and skillset.
* Ability to work well with others in a modern team development environment.
* Realism. An understanding of how the new skills and concepts apply to realistic tasks. Ready transference to real tasks later in their real teams.

### What does "seasoned junior" meamn?

* large toolkit for productivity (literally, can use many tools, and easily learn more)
* design-first, intentional, systematic approach to constructing software (not "dive in and make a mess")
* "production-quality" mindset (not just "somehow make this work!")
* "product" mindset (not just "do my own technical tasks" -- thinking of the big picture of meeting real people's needs)
* "team" mindset, balancing autonomy & personal accountability with mutual support & team-wide accountability
* technical communication -- "leadership" ability to pitch others about technical proposals, and "followership" ability to understand, help refine, and back up other people's proposals
* conceptual fundamentals to understand code at least "1 layer down"
* actual implementation capability in the stack
* ability to put it all together and actually ship to production

## Androgogical approach

The curriculum adheres to the principles described in [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html), in particular [this unit](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process).

In particular, we strive for _backward design_ and a _flavor of production realism_.
