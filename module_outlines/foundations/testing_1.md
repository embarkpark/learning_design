# Testing 1
_Writing unit tests for existing code._

### Professionals do not omit testing.
* High-quality construction includes verification of the work.
* Formally checking the correctness of the system obviously improves maintainability (fewer bugs).
* It can be tempting to omit testing, but doing so is a false economy -- it slows you down overall.

### Automate your testing.
* Manual verification is time-consuming and not fully reliable, because human error.
* Automated verification is less time-consuming and more reliable, because computers :)
* Thus: **write automated tests**

### Types of automated test
* There are several types of automated tests: {intro the testing pyramid}.
* We will focus on unit tests here.
* A "unit" == "the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system".
* Many consider this to be a function. (In O-O this is often considered a whole class, not just one function.)
* In this module we will focus on functions as units.
