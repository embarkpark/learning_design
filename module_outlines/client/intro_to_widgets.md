# Intro to Widgets

### Widgets are integral to Flutter
* Flutter provides many pre-built UI components, called "widgets".
    * Example: show adding some visibly-rendered widget to an existing page
* To build useful Flutter apps, you must learn how to use many of these widgets.

### Widgets are just classes
* Flutter widgets are not magical, they are just classes.
* Since they are just classes, you can
    * inspect and modify their properties and
    * read their code
* Example: Revisit the simple program from "Running your first program" in `A first taste of Flutter` module, focusing on the widgets.

Learning goal: _inspect and modify widget properties_

### A rendered page is composed of widget objects
* reminder: an "object" in O-O is an instance of a class
* Flutter code that makes a page is basically a bunch of constructor calls
    * the actual widget class definition are not here
        * they are in other source code files, often in the Flutter framework code itself

Learning goal: _Become comfortable with adding widget objects to a page_
