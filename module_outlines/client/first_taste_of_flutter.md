# A first taste of Flutter

### the Flutter framework and Flutter widgets

* Flutter is a _framework_ that lets you write applications in the Dart _language_ to access most of the native services of the Android or iOS _platforms_.
	* Review: see "Tech Stack Concepts 1"
* Flutter allows you to write in one language and in one framework for both iOS and Android.
	* This reduces learning time and development time.
