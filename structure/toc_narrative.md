A narrative approach to understanding the flow of the entire course.

## Orienting ourselves around clear intended outcomes

Our starting point is that we intend to deliver as:

* application programmers
* professional programmers

Some aspects of being a professional application programmer are:

* product-minded
    * user-centric, customer-centric
* team-minded
    * balancing autonomy w/ inclusivity
* -ilities aware
    * balancing tech debt w/ delivery constraints
* always learning and teaching
    * low-ego
    * balancing learning & exploration w/ delivery constraints

## Meta-learning

The set of concepts and skills required to accomplish the above is both broad and deep.

In order to learn all this effectively, it's helpful for us to learn about learning.

[TODO] summarize: 

* _Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning_, in particular the meat is chapter 8
* cognitive load theory, schemata, pros/cons of concrete vs abstract entry points
* emphasize that learning that hasn't moved into long-term memory is not that helpful -- we have to remember wtf we "learned"...

## What is an application? (from a learning perspective)

So, we aim to make applications.

Let's first establish what an application is, at a high level.

Applications are of course programs, and all programs process input into output.

1. The user interface captures input, and 
2. program logic processes that into output 
3. to be displayed by the user interface.

When we think "UI" (user interface), we tend to think of something like this:

However for initial learning purposes, let's think of "user interface" as including plain text via the command-line.

For example, the [`cat` program](https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/cat.c) that comes standard with the Unix family of operating systems (e.g., Linux and MacOS), has a command-line interface.

Here we use `cat` to print out the contents of `quote.txt`.

```
[formative_assessment]
* What is the input to this program?
* Describe the steps of processing that the program performs.
* What is the output of the program?
```

## 

### Is this really just one program?

We launched the `cat` program and gave it input.

How did we launch `cat`, though?

* terminal, shell, and shell environment variables

---------------

chain of input and output
piped unix programs

---------------

run in a loop and store info in memory across inputs
