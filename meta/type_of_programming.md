What type of programming do we want to cover in this training?

## _Professional_ programming

In this training, we will be learning how to program professionally.

This is not as simple as "learning JavaScript", "learning Go", "learning Docker", etc.

Professional programming is far more than learning the syntax of programming languages, or the details of using some tools.

Modern software development involves using many tools and techniques, it's true. And those must be learned, hands-on, in order to get work done.

But at its core, professional programming is about problem-solving. A never-ending stream of complex, overlapping problems for real customers.

And our solutions must be on schedule, on budget, match specifications, well-tested, run quickly, be secure, be easy to troubleshoot, safe to change later, etc.

We want you to understand the real-world constraints and requirements that shape our work, and how we tend to deal successfully with them.

Some patterns generally lead to better software. Some patterns generally lead to worse software.  While we are learning languages, tools and techniques, let's learn those patterns too.

Then you can apply them to your real work later.


## Professional _application_ programming

There are many kinds of programming: scientific programming, graphics programming, embedded (device) programming, machine learning, AR/VR, etc.

Broadly, we can also categorize programs like this: 

1. systems programming
2. utilities and tools programming
3. application programming

In this training we are focusing on building user-facing applications.
