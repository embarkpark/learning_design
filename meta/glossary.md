* **Rubber duck debugging**
  > "In software engineering, rubber duck debugging (or rubberducking) is a method of debugging code by articulating a problem in spoken or written natural language.  
  > The name is a reference to a story in the book [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/) in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck."
