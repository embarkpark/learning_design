# Androgogical approach

## Research-based

The curriculum adheres to the principles described in [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html).

This meta-resource assembles lots of extant principles and techniques, with proper references. It's a bit of a hodgepodge, but see in particular [this unit](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process).

## Themes

In particular, we strive for:

1. _backward design_
2. _flavor of production realism_.

## ~~MBL~~

~~The curriculum is intended to reflect [mastery-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning), aka mastery learning.~~
